# Battle-of-the-machines
Lead your PC to glory! Start from scrap and make it the most powerful computer out there. Do quests, buy parts or clock the current to achieve the unthinkable.

## Gameplay
The world of BOTM takes place thousands of years in the future. The human race has extincted  long time ago - all that's left are the intelligent machines that humans created. They are born as Pravetz computers and work all their lives to upgrade their components.
***
The androids have four main components: Processor, Ram, LAN card and Graphics card. They can go on quests, test their abilities and get rewards. With this reward they can go to the shop and upgrade their components.

### Ranking
The androids dreams are to appear in the top 3 ranking on the home page. Only the most powerful ones can appear there. The power is calculated based on their components' power:
* **Processor**
  * Cores
  * Core Speed
* **Ram**
  * Memory
  * Memory Speed
* **Graphics**
  * Cores
  * Core Speed
  * Video Memory

Other than buying and upgrading components with reward money, the androids can also downgrade their components annd get money back so if they need the money for quest of other type, they can get it.

## In da kitchen
The leaders, rulers and gods of the BOTM world are the **ADMINS**. The **ADMINS** can create new components, quests, players and even new **ADMINS**. If you're just Ð° pitiful android, be very kind to them and they can make you great!

### *Good luck and have fun!*
